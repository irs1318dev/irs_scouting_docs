## 1. Verify Python Installation

Before we install an IDE, let's verify that Python works.

1. Type `python -V` at the command prompt.

2. You will probably see a `python` is not recognized error. To fix this, add *C:\Users\{your_account_name}\Anaconda3* to the `Path` variable per the process specified in ISD02.

3. Try typing `python -V` again. You should see this:

## 2. Download and Install Pycharm IDE

Next we'll download and install the Pycharm integrated development environment (IDE) -- an IDE is sort of a sophistcated word processor for computer programming.

1. Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download and download the *Community Edition* of Pycharm for your operating system.

2. Run the installer program and accept all default options.
