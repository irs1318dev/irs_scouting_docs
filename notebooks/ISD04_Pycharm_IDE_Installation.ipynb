    "\n",
    "Now that we've downloaded the scouting system code, it would be useful to have a tool for viewing and editing the code. The IRS uses the Pycharm integrated development environment (IDE) for programming in Python. An IDE is sort of a sophistcated word processor for computer programming. This document explains how to download and install the IDE, and how to create an IDE project so you can open and edit the code in the IDE.\n",

    "1. Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download and download the *Community Edition* of Pycharm for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the installer program and accept all default options.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. By default, Pycharm displays code files and subfolders in the project window on the left, and file contents on the right. The top row of the project window represents the top folder of the project folder. Expand the top row by clicking the adjacent down arrow to view the contents. Navigate down to the *Server/Scouting/match.py* folder and open it to view the contents. The right side window now displays the Python code contained in this file:\n",
