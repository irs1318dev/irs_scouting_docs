    "The PostgreSQL database server is a crucial part of the IRS scouting system. PostgreSQL is a database server that stores the data entered into the scouting system and subsequently retrives data for display and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installation\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ and download the Windows installer for PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the installer. When asked for a password, enter `irs1318`. Otherwise select all default options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Configure Database Service\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Postgresql will run in the background all the time. You probably don't want a database server running all of the time on your computer. To change the default behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify the location of your Postgresql data directory. Itâ€™s probably located in `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Refer to section ISD02 and add an environment variable called PGDATA (if it doesn't already exist). The value of the environment variable will be the location of the PostgreSQL data directory (`C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\data`)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Edit PGDATA Variable](images/ISD05/env_pgdata.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. While you have the environment variable dialogs open, add the location of the Postgresql *bin* folder to the `Path` variable for your account. It's probably at `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\bin`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Type \"Services\" into the task bar search box and select the *Services* desktop app. \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Find and double-click on the *Postgresql-x64-10* service.\n",
