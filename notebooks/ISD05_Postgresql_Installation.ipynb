    "The PostgreSQL database server is a crucial part of the IRS scouting system. PostgreSQL is a database server that stores the data entered into the scouting system and subsequently retrives data for display and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installation\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ and download the Windows installer for PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the installer. When asked for a password, enter `irs1318`. Otherwise select all default options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Configure Database Service\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Postgresql will run in the background all the time. You probably don't want a database server running all of the time on your computer. To change the default behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify the location of your Postgresql data directory. Itâ€™s probably located in `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Refer to section ISD02 and add an environment variable called PGDATA (if it doesn't already exist). The value of the environment variable will be the location of the PostgreSQL data directory (`C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\data`)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Edit PGDATA Variable](images/ISD05/env_pgdata.png)\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "4. Type \"Services\" into the task bar search box and select the *Services* desktop app. \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Find and double-click on the *Postgresql-x64-10* service.\n",

    "## 5. Using Microsoft Access to View Contents of Scouting Database\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install the PostgreSQL ODBC driver from https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/. ODBC, which stands for open database connectivity, is a standard protocol for programs to commmunicate with database servers. Microsoft Access will use the ODBC driver to communicate with the PostgreSQL database server.\n",

    "  * Check the version dates and download the most recent version of the driver, most likely located at the bottom of the page.\n",
    "  * PostgreSQL gives you the choice of downloading either the 32 or 64 bit versions of the ODBC driver.\n",
    "    * Only download the 64-bit version (file name ends in *x64*) if you installed the 64-bit version of Microsoft Access. Otherwise download and install the 32-bit version (file name ends in *x86*). Even though you probably have a 64-bit computer, you probably have the 32-bit version of Access because that's what Microsoft installs by default.\n",
    "    * You can use the Microsoft Office installation location to determine whether you have the 32 or 64-bit version. If Microsoft Office is installed in *C:\\Program Files (x86)*, you have the 32-bit version. If it's installed in *C:\\Program Files*, then you have the 64-bit version.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Open Microsoft Access and create a new empty database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select *External Data -> New Data Scource -> From Other Sources -> ODBC Database* from the ribbon bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select *Link to the datasource by creating a linked table* and click *OK*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Select the *Machine Data Source* tab and click *New*.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Leave *User Data Source* checked and click *Next*.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Select the *PostgreSQL Unicode* database driver from the list and click *Next*. Then click *Finish*.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Enter the database connection information into the next dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Database: scouting\n",
    "  * Server: localhost\n",
    "  * User Name: irs1318\n",
    "  * Description: IRS Scouting Database\n",
    "  * Port: 5432\n",
    "  * Password: irs1318\n",
    "  \n",
    "9. Click *Test*. You should see a dialog that says *Connection Successful*. If you get an error, double check your settings and make sure the PostgreSQL database server is running. Once the test is successful, click *Save*.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Clock *OK* on the top level dialog. You should now see a list of all tables in the scouting database. Click *Select All* and *OK*.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Next, Access will display a list of all fields in the *measures* table and will ask to select up to 10 fields that uniquely idenitfy each row (this is happening because the *measures* table uses a multi-field primary key -- all other tables in the database use a single *id* column for the primary key). Select *date _id, event_id, level_id, match_id, alliance_id, team_id, actor_id, task_id, phase_id, and reason_id* and click *OK*.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Now you should see a list of tables in the scouting database. Double click on any tables to see it's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Save the database to a new file (*File -> *Save As*) before closing it, to ensure the links to the PostgreSQL tables are saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Other useful things you can do in Access: \n",
    "\n",
    "  * View database diagrams (relationships, table structure).\n",
    "  * Change a datapoint for troubleshooting. Be careful -- make a backup of the database before you do this!"
